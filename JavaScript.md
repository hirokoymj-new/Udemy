# Udemy Advanced JavaScript

## "use strict" mode
- It forces you to use valuables that have been declared with `var` keyword. This is to avoid accidentally declareing a gloval valuable.
- Waring reserved JavaScript keyword - ex. let
- It can't delete functions or arguments. 
- It's safer to use "eval()" in strict mode because the value doesn't leak out. In without strict mode, the value inside eval leaks.
