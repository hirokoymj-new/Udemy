# What is the difference between prototypal and classical inheritance?

- inheritance: classical: Java, C++ (class, instance)
- inheritance: prototypal: JavaScript (Pseudo-Classical Pattern, construction pattern)
- New objects are created from existing objects. (Ex. We build a house based on an existing house.)
